GIT

github allows us to post git repository

repository is the folder where all the changes are saved.

ls- a -> it shows all the hidden file.

git status -> git status is for it looks for ny changes happened or not ..

if you want to add one file specifically then you have to add with name or you can add with
. dot...

cat and txt name will tell what are data inside the file....
